Description:

The shady-skin is a skin for Klaus Schmidingers VDR and Louis Brauns vdr-plugin-skindesigner.


1. Requirements:

	a. vdr-plugin-skindesigner
	
	b. Font: VDROpen Sans, many other fonts are to fat and don't fit in some areas!
	
	c. A set of channellogos eg: http://creimer.net/channellogos/skindesigner-white-20150210.tar.bz2
	
	
2. Install:

	a. First time:

	cd /usr/share/vdr/plugins/skindesigner/skins
	
	git clone https://github.com/tomsax56/shady_KISS
	
	find -name *.theme -exec mv {} "/var/lib/vdr/themes" \ ;
	
	b. Update:
	
	cd /usr/share/vdr/plugins/skindesigner/skins/shady_KISS
	
	git pull
	
		
3. Setup:

	a. "Defaultcolumnwidth" yes or no, default "yes"
	
		Preferably you test both settings with eg epgsearch-searchtimermenu or mailplugin which setting sweet your needs.
		
		If in doubt switch it to "no".
		
	b. "Show timers in mainmenu" yes or no, default "no"
	
	c. "Pixelgraphicbackground in menus" yes or no, default "yes"
	
		Smoother gradients of menubackgrounds, perhaps not recommended for "weak" systems, try both ;)
